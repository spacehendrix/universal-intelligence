## Overview

`Universal Intelligence` (aka `UIN`) aims to **make AI development accessible to everyone** through a **simple interface**, which can *optionally* be *customized* to **grow with you as you learn**, up to production readiness. 

It provides both a **standard protocol**, and a **library of components** implementating the protocol for you to get started —on *any platform* ![lng_icon](https://fasplnlepuuumfjocrsu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/web-assets//icons8-python-16.png) ![lng_icon](https://fasplnlepuuumfjocrsu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/web-assets//icons8-javascript-16.png).

<br>

Welcome! Before jumping into what this project is, let's start with the basics.

#### What is an agentic app?

Agentics apps are applications which use AI. They typically use pretrained models, or agents, to interact with the user and/or achieve tasks.

#### What is a model?

Models are artificial brains, or *neural networks* in coding terms. 🧠  

They can think, but they can't act without being given the appropriate tools for the job. They are *trained* to produce a specific output, given a specific input. These can be of any type (often called modalities —eg. text, audio, image, video).

#### What is a tool?

Tools are scripted tasks, or *functions* in coding terms. 🔧

They can't think, but they can be used to achieve a pre-defined task (eg. executing a script, making an API call, interacting with a database).

#### What is an agent?

Agents are robots, or simply put, *models and tools connected together*. 🤖

> 🤖 = 🧠 + [🔧, 🔧,..]

They can think *and* act. They typically use a model to decompose a task into a list of actions, and use the appropriate tools to perform these actions.

#### What is `⚪ Universal Intelligence`?

UIN is a protocol aiming to standardize, simplify and modularize these fundamental AI components (ie. models, tools and agents), for them to be accessible to any developer, and distributed on any platform.

It provides three specifications: `Universal Model`, `Universal Tool`, and `Universal Agent`.

UIN also provides a set of **ready-made components and [playgrounds](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19RasWzFIZkbHeWDLGk9s2Tq8_Ws2G4O_?usp=sharing)** for you to get familiar with the protocol and start building in seconds.

`Universal Intelligence` standardizes, simplifies and modularizes the usage and distribution of artifical intelligence, for it to be accessible by any developers, and distributed on any platform.

It aims to be a **framework-less agentic protocol**, removing the need for proprietary frameworks (eg. Langchain, Google ADK, Autogen, CrewAI) to build *simple, portable and composable intelligent applications*.

It does so by standardizing the fundamental building blocks used to make an intelligent application (models, tools, agents), which agentic frameworks typically (re)define and build upon —and by ensuring these blocks can communicate and run on any hardware (model, size, and precision dynamically set; agents share resources).

It provides three specifications: `Universal Model`, `Universal Tool`, and `Universal Agent`.

This project also provides a set of **community-built components and playgrounds**, implementing the UIN specification, for you to get familiar with the protocol and start building in seconds.

![lng_icon](https://fasplnlepuuumfjocrsu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/web-assets//icons8-python-16.png) ![lng_icon](https://fasplnlepuuumfjocrsu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/web-assets//icons8-javascript-16.png) `Universal Intelligence` protocols and components can be used across **all platforms** (cloud, desktop, web, mobile).


#### Agentic Framework vs. Agentic Protocol

> How do they compare?

Agent frameworks (like Langchain, Google ADK, Autogen, CrewAI), each orchestrate their own versions of so-called building blocks. Some of them implement the building blocks themselves, others have them built by the community. 
  
UIN hopes to standardize those building blocks and remove the need for a framework to run/orchestrate them. It also adds a few cool features to these blocks like portability. 
For example, UIN models are designed to automatically detect the current hardware (cuda, mps, webgpu), its available memory, and run the appropriate quantization and engine for it (eg. transformers, llama.cpp, mlx, web-llm). It allows developers not to have to implement different stacks to support different devices when running models locally, and (maybe more importantly) not to have to know or care about hardware compatibility, so long as they don't try to run a rocket on a gameboy 🙂

## Protocol Specifications

### Universal Model

A `⚪ Universal Model` is a standardized, self-contained and configurable interface able to run a given model, irrespective of the consumer hardware and without requiring domain expertise.

It embeddeds a model (i.e. hosted, fetched, or local), one or more engines (e.g. [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index), [lama.cpp](https://llama-cpp-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-reference/), [mlx-lm](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm), [web-llm](https://webllm.mlc.ai)), runtime dependencies for each device type (e.g. CUDA, MPS), and exposes a standard interface.

While configurable, every aspect is preset for the user, based on *automatic device detection and dynamic model precision*, in order to abstract complexity and provide a simplified and portable interface.

> *Providers*: In the intent of preseting a `Universal Model` for non-technical mass adoption, we recommend defaulting to 4 bit quantization.

### Universal Tool

A `⚪ Universal Tool` is a standardized tool interface, usable by any `Universal Agent`.

Tools allow interacting with other systems (e.g. API, database) or performing scripted tasks.

> When `Universal Tools` require accessing remote services, we recommend standardizing those remote interfaces as well using [MCP Servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction), for greater portability. Many MCP servers have already been shared with the community and are ready to use, see [available MCP servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) for details.

### Universal Agent

A `⚪ Universal Agent` is a standardized, configurable and ***composable*** agent, powered by a `Universal Model`, `Universal Tools` and other `Universal Agents`.

While configurable, every aspect is preset for the user, in order to abstract complexity and provide a simplified and portable interface.

Through standardization, `Universal Agent` can seemlessly and dynamically integrate with other `Universal Intelligence` components to achieve any task, and/or share hardware recources (i.e. sharing a common `Universal Model`) —allowing it to ***generalize and scale at virtually no cost***.

> When `Universal Agents` require accessing remote agents, we recommend leveraging Google's [A2A Protocols](https://github.com/google/A2A/tree/main), for greater compatibility.

In simple terms:

> Universal Model = 🧠
>
> Universal Tool = 🔧
>
> Universal Agent = 🤖
>
> 🤖 = 🧠 + [🔧, 🔧,..] + [🤖, 🤖,..]

### Usage

#### Universal Model

```python
from <provider> import UniversalModel as Model

model = Model()
output, logs = model.process('How are you today?') # 'Feeling great! How about you?'
```

> Automatically optimized for any supported device 🔥

##### Customization Options

Simple does not mean limited. Most advanted `configuration` options remain available.

Those are defined by and specific to the *universal model provider*.

> We encourage providers to use industry standard [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) specifications, irrespective of the backend internally used for the detected device and translated accordingly, allowing for greater portability and adoption.

### Development

Abstract classes and types for `Universal Intelligence` components are made available by the package if you wish to develop and publish your own.

```sh
# Install abstracts
pip install universal-intelligence
```

```python
from universal_intelligence.core import AbstractUniversalModel, AbstractUniversalTool, AbstractUniversalAgent, types

class UniversalModel(AbstractUniversalModel):
  # ...
  pass

class UniversalTool(AbstractUniversalTool):
  # ...
  pass

class UniversalAgent(AbstractUniversalAgent):
  # ...
  pass
```

If you wish to contribute to community based components, [mixins](https://github.com/spacehendrix/universal-intelligence/blob/main/universal_intelligence/community/models/__utils__/mixins) are made available to allow quickly bootstrapping new `Universal Models`.

## Community Components

The `universal-intelligence` package provides several community-built models, agents, and tools that you can use out of the box.

### Installation

```sh
# Install with device optimizations
pip install "universal-intelligence[community,mps]" # Apple
pip install "universal-intelligence[community,cuda]" # NVIDIA
```

Some components may require additional dependencies. These can be installed on demand.

```sh
# Install MCP specific dependencies
pip install "universal-intelligence[community,mps,mcp]" # Apple
pip install "universal-intelligence[community,cuda,mcp]" # NVIDIA
```

> Some of the community components interface with gated models, in which case you may have to accept the model's terms on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/models-gated) and log into that approved account. 
> 
> You may do so in your terminal using `huggingface-cli login`
> 
> or in your code: 
> ```python
> from huggingface_hub import login
> login()
> ```

| Text/Text | *arcee-ai/arcee-blitz* | `arcee_blitz` | Arcee Blitz is a 24 B‑parameter dense model distilled from DeepSeek and built on Mistral architecture for 'everyday' chat. The distillation‑plus‑refinement pipeline trims compute while keeping DeepSeek‑style reasoning, so Blitz punches above its weight on MMLU, GSM‑8K and BBH compared with other mid‑size open models. With a default 128 k context window and competitive throughput, it serves as a cost‑efficient workhorse for summarization, brainstorming and light code help. Internally, Arcee uses Blitz as the default writer in Conductor pipelines when the heavier Virtuoso line is not required. Users therefore get near‑70 B quality at ~⅓ the latency and price.  |  `openrouter` |
| Text/Text | *arcee-ai/caller-large* | `caller_large` | Caller Large is Arcee's specialist 'function‑calling' SLM built to orchestrate external tools and APIs. Instead of maximizing next‑token accuracy, training focuses on structured JSON outputs, parameter extraction and multi‑step tool chains, making Caller a natural choice for retrieval‑augmented generation, robotic process automation or data‑pull chatbots. It incorporates a routing head that decides when (and how) to invoke a tool versus answering directly, reducing hallucinated calls. The model is already the backbone of Arcee Conductor's auto‑tool mode, where it parses user intent, emits clean function signatures and hands control back once the tool response is ready. Developers thus gain an OpenAI‑style function‑calling UX without handing requests to a frontier‑scale model.  |  `openrouter` |
| Text/Text | *arcee-ai/coder-large* | `coder_large` | Coder‑Large is a 32 B‑parameter offspring of Qwen 2.5‑Instruct that has been further trained on permissively‑licensed GitHub, CodeSearchNet and synthetic bug‑fix corpora. It supports a 32k context window, enabling multi‑file refactoring or long diff review in a single call, and understands 30‑plus programming languages with special attention to TypeScript, Go and Terraform. Internal benchmarks show 5–8 pt gains over CodeLlama‑34 B‑Python on HumanEval and competitive BugFix scores thanks to a reinforcement pass that rewards compilable output. The model emits structured explanations alongside code blocks by default, making it suitable for educational tooling as well as production copilot scenarios. Cost‑wise, Together AI prices it well below proprietary incumbents, so teams can scale interactive coding without runaway spend.  |  `openrouter` |
| Text/Text | *arcee-ai/maestro-reasoning* | `maestro_reasoning` | Maestro Reasoning is Arcee's flagship analysis model: a 32 B‑parameter derivative of Qwen 2.5‑32 B tuned with DPO and chain‑of‑thought RL for step‑by‑step logic. Compared to the earlier 7 B preview, the production 32 B release widens the context window to 128 k tokens and doubles pass‑rate on MATH and GSM‑8K, while also lifting code completion accuracy. Its instruction style encourages structured 'thought → answer' traces that can be parsed or hidden according to user preference. That transparency pairs well with audit‑focused industries like finance or healthcare where seeing the reasoning path matters. In Arcee Conductor, Maestro is automatically selected for complex, multi‑constraint queries that smaller SLMs bounce.  |  `openrouter` |
| Text/Text | *arcee-ai/virtuoso-large* | `virtuoso_large` | Virtuoso‑Large is Arcee's top‑tier general‑purpose LLM at 72 B parameters, tuned to tackle cross‑domain reasoning, creative writing and enterprise QA. Unlike many 70 B peers, it retains the 128 k context inherited from Qwen 2.5, letting it ingest books, codebases or financial filings wholesale. Training blended DeepSeek R1 distillation, multi‑epoch supervised fine‑tuning and a final DPO/RLHF alignment stage, yielding strong performance on BIG‑Bench‑Hard, GSM‑8K and long‑context Needle‑In‑Haystack tests. Enterprises use Virtuoso‑Large as the 'fallback' brain in Conductor pipelines when other SLMs flag low confidence. Despite its size, aggressive KV‑cache optimizations keep first‑token latency in the low‑second range on 8× H100 nodes, making it a practical production‑grade powerhouse. |  `openrouter` |
| Text/Text | *arcee-ai/virtuoso-medium-v2* | `virtuoso_medium_v2` | Virtuoso‑Medium‑v2 is a 32 B model distilled from DeepSeek‑v3 logits and merged back onto a Qwen 2.5 backbone, yielding a sharper, more factual successor to the original Virtuoso Medium. The team harvested ~1.1 B logit tokens and applied 'fusion‑merging' plus DPO alignment, which pushed scores past Arcee‑Nova 2024 and many 40 B‑plus peers on MMLU‑Pro, MATH and HumanEval. With a 128 k context and aggressive quantization options (from BF16 down to 4‑bit GGUF), it balances capability with deployability on single‑GPU nodes. Typical use cases include enterprise chat assistants, technical writing aids and medium‑complexity code drafting where Virtuoso‑Large would be overkill.  |  `openrouter` |

It is designed to maintain coherence and reasoning across long multi-turn conversations by introducing explicit reasoning steps per dialogue turn, generated and refined using the base model itself. The model was trained using RS-QLORA+ on 8K sequence lengths and supports up to 128K context windows (with practical performance around 32K). It is optimized for creative roleplay and dialogue generation, with an emphasis on minimizing cross-context repetition while preserving stylistic diversity. |  `openrouter` |

Notes on Pricing ([Source](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/pricing#detailed-pricing-breakdown-for-sonar-deep-research)) - Input tokens comprise of Prompt tokens (user prompt) + Citation tokens (these are processed tokens from running searches)- Deep Research runs multiple searches to conduct exhaustive research. Searches are priced at $5/1000 searches. A request that does 30 searches will cost $0.15 in this step.- Reasoning is a distinct step in Deep Research since it does extensive automated reasoning through all the material it gathers during its research phase. Reasoning tokens here are a bit different than the CoTs in the answer - these are tokens that we use to reason through the research material prior to generating the outputs via the CoTs. Reasoning tokens are priced at $3/1M tokens |  `openrouter` |

Excels in structured tasks and benchmarks like GPQA, LCB, and MMLU-Pro where it outperforms Grok 3 Mini even on high thinking.  Note: That there are two xAI endpoints for this model. By default when using this model we will always route you to the base endpoint. If you want the fast endpoint you can add `provider: { sort: throughput}`, to sort by throughput instead.  |  `openrouter` |
| Text/Text | *x-ai/grok-3-mini-beta* | `grok_3_mini_beta` | Grok 3 Mini is a lightweight, smaller thinking model. Unlike traditional models that generate answers immediately, Grok 3 Mini thinks before responding. It's ideal for reasoning-heavy tasks that don't demand extensive domain knowledge, and shines in math-specific and quantitative use cases, such as solving challenging puzzles or math problems. Transparent 'thinking' traces accessible. Defaults to low reasoning, can boost with setting `reasoning: { effort: 'high' }` Note: That there are two xAI endpoints for this model. By default when using this model we will always route you to the base endpoint. If you want the fast endpoint you can add `provider: { sort: throughput}`, to sort by throughput instead.  |  `openrouter` |

#### Creating New Components

For faster deployment and easier maintenance, we recommend using/enhancing *shared* mixins to bootstrap new `Universal Intelligence` components. Those are made available at `./universal_intelligence/community/<component>/__utils__/mixins`. Mixins let components provide their own configurations and while levering a shared implementation. You can find an example here: [./universal_intelligence/community/models/qwen2_5_7b_instruct/model.py](https://github.com/spacehendrix/universal-intelligence/blob/main/universal_intelligence/community/models/qwen2_5_7b_instruct/model.py).

> Model weights can be found here: https://huggingface.co 

#### Testing

Each `Universal Intelligence` component comes with its own test suite.

#### Running Tests

Installation:

```sh
# (optional) Create dedicated python environment using miniconda
conda init zsh
conda create -n universal-intelligence python=3.10.16 -y
conda activate universal-intelligence

# Install base dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install community components dependencies
pip install -r requirements-community.txt

# Install optimizations for your currect device
pip install -r requirements-mps.txt # Apple devices
pip install -r requirements-cuda.txt # NVIDIA devices

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Install commit hook
pre-commit install

# (optional) if using the MCP tool, install dedicated MCP specific dependencies
pip install -r requirements-mcp.txt
```

> Some of the community components interface with gated models, in which case you may have to accept the model's terms on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/models-gated) and log into that approved account. 
> 
> You may do so in your terminal using `huggingface-cli login`
> 
> or in your code: 
> ```python
> from huggingface_hub import login
> login()
> ```

Testing:

```bash
# python -m universal_intelligence.community.<component>.<name>.test

# examples
python -m universal_intelligence.community.models.default.test
python -m universal_intelligence.community.tools.default.test
python -m universal_intelligence.community.agents.default.test
```

> Please note that running tests may require downloading multiple configurations of the same components, and temporarily use storage space.
> Tests will be automatically filtered based on hardware requirements.

Clear downloaded models from storage:

```sh
# pip install huggingface_hub["cli"] # Install CLI
huggingface-cli delete-cache # Clear cache
```
